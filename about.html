<div align="justify"> <br />
  Created for the 2012 YCC App Challenge, Wuzopen ensures you never again have to ask yourself whether the UPS Office is open or what restaurants still serve food at 3:00AM. Wuzopen shows you what's open at this very moment, from restaurants to libraries to facilities and more.
  <br />
  <br />
  </div>
  <h2 style="clear:both">How to Use</h2>
<div align="justify"> <br />
White locations are open. Grey locations are closed. Search by name with the search box or filter by different categories with one of the filter buttons. The website will automatically update every minute, so you always get up-to-date information. You can also check what locations are open at a given time. The time travel features make time move forward faster, as a demo of how the application updates over time.
<br/><br/>

   Note: For irregular schedules (i.e. libraries during reading week) and holidays, the data in the application may not be accurate. The application is meant to function for the normal hours of a location. Also, Gourmet Heaven is always open. To guarantee accuracy, visit the website of the location in question.
