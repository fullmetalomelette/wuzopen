<h2>Wuzopen?</h2><br /><br />
Created for the 2012 YCC App Challenge, Wuzopen ensures you never again have to ask yourself whether the UPS Office is open or what restaurants still serve food at 3:00AM. Wuzopen uses a simple and elegant interface to let you see what's open at this very moment, from restaurants to libraries to facilities and more. Want to know what's open at a specific time in the future? Want to favorite a couple of places? Want to quickly see some ratings and a link to Google Maps directions? We've got all those features and we're adding additional ones every week. 
<br /><br />
Know a cool place that's not listed on our site? Use the 'add-location' feature to add it yourself. We'll do our best to include it as soon as possible. For comments and sugggestions, please email contact@wuzopen.com.
